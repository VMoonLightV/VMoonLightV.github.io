Hello, here is Yuyang Lou's home page. Currently I'm an undergraduate at USTC, but I'm going to pursue my PhD degree at HKUST in Prof. Sherry's group.

My research interest lies in AI4S field, and I'm study deepqmc methods in Prof.Sherry's group now. I think AI4S could provide a new paradigm for Science discovery in the future, which could change the way of our Science research.

Previously I conducted particle physics experiment research, searching for the decay of Higgs into a pair of muons. However, due to my personal transition of research interest, I decided to turn to the AI4S field, which has more probability.

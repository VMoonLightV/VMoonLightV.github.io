Hello, here is Yuyang Lou's home page. Currently I'm an undergraduate at USTC, but I'm going to pursue my PhD degree at HKUST under cosupervision of Prof. Ding Pan and Prof. Lixue Cheng.

My research interest lies in AI4S field, and I'm study deepqmc method now. I think AI4S could provide a new paradigm for Science discovery in the future, which could change the way of our Science research and discovery.

Previously I conducted particle physics experiment research, searching for the decay of Higgs into a pair of muons. However, due to my personal transition of research interest, I decided to turn to the AI4S field, which has more potential in the future.

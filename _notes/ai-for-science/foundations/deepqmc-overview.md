title: "DeepQMC Overview"
---

This note collects quick references on what DeepQMC tries to solve and the pieces that make up a practical workflow:

- Variational Monte Carlo as the optimization backbone.
- Neural networks for trial wavefunctions with backflow features.
- How electron-electron cusps appear in realistic benchmarks.

The goal is to keep a concise list of assumptions, objective functions, and implementation checkpoints that are easy to consult while prototyping.
